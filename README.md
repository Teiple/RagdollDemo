# RagdollDemo
A simple Godot project to show how ragdolls can be spawned.

This way of implementation is useful for making enemies become ragdolls after they are killed.

This project was made on Godot version 4.1.3 Mono, but you can open it in Godot 4.1.3 Standard as it does not contain any C# scripts.
